## My process

### Built with

- HTML5, CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- React
- Tailwind
- Python
- Flask
- MySQL

### What I learned

For this project I created a full stack app. For the backend I used Python, Flask and MySQL. This was my first time using Python and Flask and so I learned a whole bunch about the language and framework. It was also my first time to use MySQL outside of a classroom environment and I was able to reinforce concepts previously learned.
